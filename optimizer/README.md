# Optimizer

We spent a ton of hours trying to get the optimizer to work, but never could.

Here is the closets we could get with Python to optimizing the QoE (this seems to run forever and not get any closer to an optimal solution).

We also battled with the open source GLPK and closed source CEPLEX (in optimize.mod) but that was not fruitful either at the end of the day.

You can install pyOpt with the setup.py script and then run our optimizer if you'd like.
